## Hola amiguitos

This branch is for building TWRP recovery & derivatives, based on my crDroid device tree for OnePlus 6T (fajita).
TWRP commits adapted from work by:
* nebrassy <nebras30@gmail.com>
* siddhrsh <skoyande17@gmail.com>
* others I'm sure (like, y'know, mauronofrio <poronofrio@gmail.com>)
* ...and the financial support of viewers like you!

Rebased on the official lineage-18.1 branch of the LineageOS device tree as of September 2021.
